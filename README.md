CS 396: Web Development
Summer 2024

Unit 4:

For Unit 4, the first effect I wanted to incorporate using JavaScript was light/dark mode! I was able to do this by having a button on each page that uses a JavaScript function to toggle from light mode, which has a white background with purple text, to dark mode, which has a purple background with white text. This was not too hard to incorporate, but I do intend to resubmit with improved styling! Furthermore, I did not fully complete my second effect and had to create a copy of my current project folder so that the code did not get too messed up. I wanted to feel safe tweaking it without ruining any other functionalities. I plan to resubmit with a second effect, as I will work on it over the weekend now that my internship load is easing up after my midpoint! I am thinking of doing a cool effect with images that enlarges them or even changes their shape when hovering over them, or doing a cool font adjuster with JavaScript, as suggested.
